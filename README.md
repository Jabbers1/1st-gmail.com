Hello Everyone!

JJB here. I'm not completely sure what I am meant to be writing here.
Never done any coding before and barely computer literate but at a later stage in life has discovered the traveling bug.
Just trying to learn how to earn money anywhere in the world with a laptop and connectivity, coding seems like a good option!
